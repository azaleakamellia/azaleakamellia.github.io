      <description>The horror of static website development In the pursuit of actually trying something myself instead of asking for help, I always end up in some sort of self-imposed misery. Creating static website is one of it although developing some web application still reigns top.&#xA;It always felt like a ruse when people tell you that something is easy or simple. But, truth be told, web development, static or not, isn&amp;rsquo;t easy.</description>

      <description>MBR 2023 is a peak event that culminates all the effort of data collection and stock take of hydrocarbon resource in the Malaysia. It is an annual event that put together all the exploration blocks, discoverable hydrocarbon fields and late life assets for upstream sectors to evaluate and invest in.&#xA;Leading up to the event, the Malaysia Petroleum Management (MPM) updates, re-evaluate and produces maps; static and digital, to cater to the need for the most recent stock-take of information that can be obtained from various source of exploration output; seismic, full tensor gradiometry, assets; cables, pipelines, platforms, as well as discoverable resources.</description>

      <description>The northern highland communities of Lun Bawang have been collaborating with WWF-Malaysia under the Sarawak Conservation Programme (SCP) to empower sustainable economies and managing their natural biodiversity through the Community Empowerment Strategy (formerly known as Community Engagement and Education Strategy).&#xA;Since 2016, the communities have been actively mapping out their land uses and culturally important locations to delineate their areas of settlement and source of livelihood. Given the close vicinity of their communities to the licensed timber concessions, producing a definitive map is important to preserve and conserve their surrounding natural capitals.</description>

      <description>The presentation of abstract Deep Forest Cover Classification of Consecutive Landsat Imageries over Borneo outlined the implementation of deep learning in land cover classification across the Borneo island. This study used the Sentinel-2 image data and the band combination that differentiates the bareland, tree cover as well as waterbodies and croplands whilst training the U-Net model using the referenced data collected.&#xA;Please find the abstract published here:&#xA;Warta Geologi, Vol. 47, No.</description>

Notable locations of nature&amp;rsquo;s peculiar feats are shared for those who seek to explore the northern states for the first time.</description>
