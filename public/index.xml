      <description>The northern highland communities of Lun Bawang have been collaborating with WWF-Malaysia under the Sarawak Conservation Programme (SCP) to empower sustainable economies and managing their natural biodiversity through the Community Empowerment Strategy (formerly known as Community Engagement and Education Strategy).&#xA;Since 2016, the communities have been actively mapping out their land uses and culturally important locations to delineate their areas of settlement and source of livelihood. Given the close vicinity of their communities to the licensed timber concessions, producing a definitive map is important to preserve and conserve their surrounding natural capitals.</description>

But when I find them, I&amp;rsquo;m extra extra happy.&#xA;There are 3 of them in this beautiful coffee table book entitled: &amp;lsquo;The Value of Nature; Balancing Conservation, Development and People in the Heart of Borneo&amp;rsquo;, by my super cool colleague Cynthia Chin &amp;ndash; published by WWF-Malaysia.

      <title>My First Static Website</title>

      <description>The horror of static website development In the pursuit of actually trying something myself instead of asking for help, I always end up in some sort of self-imposed misery. Creating static website is one of it although developing some web application still reigns top.&#xA;It always felt like a ruse when people tell you that something is easy or simple. But, truth be told, web development, static or not, isn&amp;rsquo;t easy.</description>
