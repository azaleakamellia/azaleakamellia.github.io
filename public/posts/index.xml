      <description>The northern highland communities of Lun Bawang have been collaborating with WWF-Malaysia under the Sarawak Conservation Programme (SCP) to empower sustainable economies and managing their natural biodiversity through the Community Empowerment Strategy (formerly known as Community Engagement and Education Strategy).&#xA;Since 2016, the communities have been actively mapping out their land uses and culturally important locations to delineate their areas of settlement and source of livelihood.

Creating static website is one of it although developing some web application still reigns top.&#xA;It always felt like a ruse when people tell you that something is easy or simple. But, truth be told, web development, static or not, isn&amp;rsquo;t easy.</description>
