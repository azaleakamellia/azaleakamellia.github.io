[Peta Gunatanah Malaysia 2014 -2018](https://arcg.is/HSbDL0) ("**Malaysia's Land Cover 2014 - 2018**") web application is a platform generated for the Quality Assessment activity organized by **Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM)** on 23rd June 2024.

The workshop aims to collect field/reference data from Malaysian's state agencies in the effort to verify the quality of the land cover classification output generated in support of **CO2 release measurement from converted agricultural lands**.

Participants are able access the app via conventional browsers from their mobile devices and submit drawings/sketches that they have captured within interactive data layers.

This web app aims to support direct input from source onto the task of improving the accuracy of the generated land cover maps. Vectors generated from this exercise are readily standardized with the required data scheme from quality assessment, making full use of the ArcGIS Online ecosystem full to a produce concrete output and actionable information.
