The presentation of abstract **Deep Forest Cover Classification of Consecutive Landsat Imageries over Borneo** outlined the implementation of deep learning in land cover classification across the Borneo island. This study used the Sentinel-2 image data and the band combination that differentiates the bareland, tree cover as well as waterbodies and croplands whilst training the U-Net model using the referenced data collected.
