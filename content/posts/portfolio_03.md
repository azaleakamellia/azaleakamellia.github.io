I rarely keep record of the maps I make and my portfolio is as thick as an amoeba. But when I find them, I'm extra extra happy.

There are 3 of them in this beautiful coffee table book entitled: 'The Value of Nature; Balancing Conservation, Development and People in the Heart of Borneo', by my super cool colleague Cynthia Chin -- published by WWF-Malaysia. The digital copy is available in Bahasa Melayu and English at the link below 👇🏻
