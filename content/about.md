Hello! 

I’m Azalea and I’m a geospatial analyst from Kuching, Malaysia. I've personally been studying and practicing GIS and remote sensing professionally for almost a decade. Over the years, I have applied my skillset through projects with universities, federal agencies, non-profit organizations and now, as a consultant.

My field of interest includes optical remote sensing and physics, historical mapping/cartography and behavioral analyis.
