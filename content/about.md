Hello! I’m Azalea Kamellia and I’m a remote sensing specialist from Kuching, Malaysia. I’ve been working with GIS technology since university and have been adapting and optimizing my skillset through projects with universities, federal agencies, non-profit organizations and now, as a consultant.

My field of interest includes optical remote sensing, cartography, democratization of spatial thinking and running.
