Hello! I’m Azalea Kamellia and I’m a remote sensing specialist from Kuching, Malaysia. I’ve been tinkering around with GIS technology and remote sensing for some time. Over the years, I have applied my skillset through projects with universities, federal agencies, non-profit organizations and now, as a consultant.

My field of interest includes optical remote sensing, cartography and running.
